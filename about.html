          an energizing snack or even as a light(er) dessert. Here I share with you two different but equally delicious
          ways to make my favorite strawberry milkshake recipe – a classic shake prepared with milk, and a plant-based

            into glasses and serve.1 cup ice cream to 1/4 cup milk is a great ratio. Blend the shake. In a blender,
            combine the milk and ice cream and blend until smooth. Add any your mix-ins and blend them in to your
            desired consistency.Yes, it's just ice cream and milk, but a few tiny tips will help you make milkshakes
            that taste just as good as the ones you usually order — even if it's without the excitement of going to the
            ice cream parlor.It's incredibly easy to over-blend a milkshake, and luckily thickening it back up is just
            as easy. Simply add an additional scoop or two of ice cream to your blender and process until the shake has
            thickened up.

            milk do not go well together. This combination can lead to indigestion and a sluggish stomach.
